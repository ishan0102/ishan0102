Hi, I'm Ishan! I love machine learning and tinkering. I'm currently building [Minion AI](https://minion.ai/) led by [Alex Graveley](https://alexgraveley.com/) and advised by [Nat Friedman](https://nat.org/). I also study computer engineering and math at UT Austin and research large language models with [Kyle Mahowald](https://mahowak.github.io/).

I've worked on machine learning infrastructure as a founding engineer at [Unreal Speech](https://unrealspeech.com/) and through internships at YouTube and Capital One. Through college, I've taught a couple hundred students, interviewed people for my school newspaper, and trained a model to play pictionary.

This semester, I'm getting good at golf and volleyball (shoutout UT PE classes!), trying every speakeasy in Austin, and learning how to cook things besides pasta.
