# Hi, I'm Ishan. 
![Profile View Counter](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ishan0102&color=blue&label=Profile+Views)

I'm an engineer, student, [writer](https://ishan.coffee), and software tinkerer. I'm currently building machine learning infrastructure for YouTube at Google.

Before Google, I developed an ML pipeline at Capital One to detect fraud in car dealerships using customer reviews. I've also [researched responsible AI](https://hai.ischool.utexas.edu/), built a tool to summarize emails with a large language model, and taught a data structures class.

I usually spend my time playing spikeball, exploring coffee shops, or wandering around national parks. Reach out at [ishan0102@utexas.edu](mailto:ishan0102@utexas.edu) if you'd like to chat!
