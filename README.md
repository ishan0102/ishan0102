# Hey, I'm Ishan!
I'm a founding engineer at [Happenstance](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/happenstance) (YC W24) and like building with LLMs in my free time. I graduated from UT Austin with degrees in Computer Engineering and Mathematics and now I live in NYC.

In the past, I've worked on:
- Distributed systems for earnings reports at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/)
- Interpretability research with [Kyle Mahowald](https://mahowak.github.io)
- LLMs for web browsing at [Minion AI](https://github.com/minionai)
- Text-to-speech model evaluation at [Unreal Speech](https://github.com/unrealspeech)
- Configurable throttling for video classifications at [YouTube](https://github.com/youtube)
- Fraud detection from customer reviews at [Capital One](https://github.com/capitalone)
