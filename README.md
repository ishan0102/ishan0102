# Hi, I'm Ishan. 
![Profile View Counter](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ishan0102&color=blue&label=Profile+Views)

I'm a junior at UT Austin studying Computer Engineering, Math, and Business. Currently, I'm a SWE Intern at Capital One working on NLP and am Corporate Director at IEEE UT. I've also written for The Daily Texan, developed web apps for a research-focused startup, led a tutoring initiative through Roden, and worked on a few freelance projects. 

I'm a self-learner and enjoy picking up new skills as I explore machine learning, backend software engineering, web development, and product design. I've worked on problems related to productivity, language summarization, and tutoring through a variety of side projects. I built [Day in Review](https://github.com/DayInReview/email-summarizer) with [Rishi Ponnekanti](https://github.com/JimothyGreene) last summer to tackle email summarization and we're working on expanding it to an AI-powered productivity suite.
